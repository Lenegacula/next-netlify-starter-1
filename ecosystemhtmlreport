         <h1>What is an ecosystem?</h1>
        <h2> what are the kinds of creatures and things in it?</h2>

        <p>Ecosystems can be of different sizes and can be marine, aquatic, or terrestrial. In ecosystems, both 
        matter and energy are conserved.Energy flows through the system--usually from light to heat--while matter
        is recycled. Ecosystems withhigher biodiversity tend to be more stable with greater resistance and resilience
        in the face of disturbances, or disruptive events. An ecosystem consists of living and nonliving things.</p>


        <h1>Living things</h1>
        <h2>Things or creature that are alive</h2>

        <p> Living things are creatures or things that live and breathe in an ecosytem. An example of a living 
        thing is a plant. Plants get their food from the sun through the process of photosynthesis. Then the 
        plant is eaten by a a small animal or insect then the insect or small animal is eaten by a bigger animal
        and so on. That is called a food web or food chain. A food web/chain shows what eats what. For example,
        Grass-->Grasshopper-->Mouse-->Cat. In this food chain, the Cat is at the top or the predator in the 
        food chain.


        <h1>Predators</h1>
        <h2>The top of the food chain</h2>

        <p> Predators are feared by many because they are on the top of the food chain. 
        Most predators are carnivores but some are omnivores, which means they eat both
        meat and plants. Like for example, a bear is an omnivore, it eats berries and fish.
        Predetors are mostly the big asnd scary animals in an ecosystem. Wolves and lions 
        are examples of predators. 
    
        <h1>Prey</h1>
        <h2>The ones that get eaten by the predetors</h1>

        <p> Prey, these are the animals that get eaten by the predetors. Most prey are 
        herbivores, or animals that eat mainly plants, herbivores . The prey are most likely vulnerable
        when it isn't with it's pack or group. A pack is a group of animlas from the same kind.
        Deers and bulls are exaples of prey. They are the ones who are mostly hunted down by
        predetors such as animals from the cat family and animals from the dog family.


        <h1>Non-living things</h1>
        <h2>The opposite of Living things</h2>

        <p>Non-living things are also important to the ecosystem because they are used by the lvivng things
        there. Like example, a rock cave can be used as shelter, the air is so the living things can breathe,
        water so the living things don'tr get dehydrated and die. Even though these things are not alive,
        they are needed in the ecosystem for the living things to thrive and multiply.
